Quick Summary of what you achieved:
You generated and added an SSH key.

You updated your Git remote to SSH.

You pushed the entire project without any password/token needed.

Your main branch is now linked (set up to track) with the remote main branch.

Now next time you just use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
→ no password, no problem!


After you change something:
Stage your changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
(This means: "I want to include ALL changed files.")

Create a commit message:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "your message explaining what you changed"
(Example: git commit -m "Fixed bug in docking script")

Push the update to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push



#####################################################
You're seeing that error because:

* There are **new commits on GitHub** that your local repo doesn't have yet.
* Git refuses to let you push until you've **pulled and merged** those changes.

---

### ✅ Step-by-step fix:

1. First, stage all your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

2. Then commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Add updated backend, frontend, and new pages"
```

3. Pull the latest changes from GitHub **and auto-merge**:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

> `--rebase` makes sure your changes go **on top of** the latest GitHub version — cleaner history, no merge commits.

4. Finally, push your work:

```bash
git push
```

This will fully sync your changes with GitHub without conflict.
